          </div>
          <p class="m" style="margin: 0px -122px 0px;">Everything came into being with an fantastic idea! Just like mine...

          This journey begins with the obstacles that i surrender while purchasing things

          mostly mobile phones.I have to visit different marketplace frequently

          in order to fulfill my needs. By doing so, i realize that the difficulty

          i face, Many facing it daily or let's say it's a boredom routine now!</p>

          <p class="m" style="margin: 0px -122px 0px;">So, i decided to overcome this awkwardness by giving a comfortable
          platform to ease humanity and i make it possible by giving them a site
          on which they are free to survey and find their needs just by doing some clicks</p>
          <p class="m" style="margin: 0px -122px 0px;">By doing this we are promoting our markets & shops also by enhancing the visibility of products
          they own. We publicly branding their products and showing them on the main page of our site</p>

          </div>
          <p>I gather my teammate and discuss this idea, he liked alot. Then we both work on it and resolve
            each and every drawbacks in it. We collect all the reviews, say that from a businessman to a common person.</p>
          <p class="o">
            And then we realize that we are incomplete without a technical guy and this need is fulfilled by
            our beloved friend who understands us & we three became partners till this day...
            And we achive it in some 180 days with lots of coffee :)</p>
